# Ideation for Improving Event Capture Interface

## 1. Dynamic Button Layout Customization

- **Idea:** Allow users to drag and drop buttons in the configuration view to visually arrange their layout instead of editing JSON manually.
- **Improvement:** This would make the configuration process more intuitive and user-friendly, especially for non-technical users. It eliminates the need to understand JSON structure and reduces the risk of errors.

## 2. Real-Time Feedback on Button Press

- **Idea:** Add visual feedback (e.g., a brief color flash or animation) when an event button is clicked.
- **Improvement:** This provides immediate confirmation to the user that their input was registered, improving confidence and reducing the chance of duplicate clicks.

## 3. Event History Panel

- **Idea:** Display a real-time list of logged events in a side panel or below the timer.
- **Improvement:** Users can quickly verify that events are being recorded correctly without switching views, enhancing efficiency during fast-paced games.

## 4. Keyboard Shortcuts for Event Buttons

- **Idea:** Assign keyboard shortcuts to frequently used event buttons (e.g., `1` for "SHOT FOR", `2` for "GOAL FOR").
- **Improvement:** This allows users to log events faster without relying solely on the mouse, which is especially useful in high-pressure situations.

## 5. Timer Enhancements

- **Idea:** Add a countdown timer option and allow users to set custom periods (e.g., 15-minute quarters).
- **Improvement:** This aligns the timer functionality with the structure of field hockey games, making it more relevant and useful.

## 6. Undo/Redo Functionality

- **Idea:** Add "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to reverse or reapply the last logged event.
- **Improvement:** This provides flexibility to correct mistakes without disrupting the flow of the game.

## 7. Event Grouping and Filtering

- **Idea:** Allow users to group events by type (e.g., "Offense", "Defense") and filter the displayed buttons dynamically.
- **Improvement:** This reduces visual clutter and makes it easier to focus on relevant events during specific phases of the game.

## 8. Responsive Design for Mobile Devices

- **Idea:** Optimize the layout for smaller screens by using collapsible sections or swipe gestures to switch between views.
- **Improvement:** This ensures the application is usable on tablets or smartphones, which are often more convenient for field-side use.

## 9. Audio Feedback

- **Idea:** Play a short sound effect when an event is logged successfully.
- **Improvement:** This provides an additional layer of feedback, especially useful when the user is not looking directly at the screen.

## 10. Predefined Event Templates

- **Idea:** Offer predefined templates for common game scenarios (e.g., "Standard Game", "Practice Session").
- **Improvement:** This reduces setup time and ensures consistency across different games.

## 11. Enhanced Accessibility

- **Idea:** Add ARIA roles and labels to all interactive elements and ensure full keyboard navigation support.
- **Improvement:** This makes the application more inclusive and usable for users with disabilities.

## 12. Data Visualization

- **Idea:** Add a small live chart or graph showing event trends (e.g., goals over time) during the game.
- **Improvement:** This provides immediate insights and makes the interface more engaging.

## 13. Dark Mode

- **Idea:** Add a toggle for dark mode to reduce eye strain during night games or low-light conditions.
- **Improvement:** This enhances usability in different lighting environments.

## 14. Quick Save and Export

- **Idea:** Add a "Quick Save" button to save the current game state and an "Export" button to download the event log as a file.
- **Improvement:** This ensures data is not lost and makes it easier to share or analyze game data post-match.

## 15. Gamification Elements

- **Idea:** Add small achievements or progress indicators (e.g., "10 events logged in under 1 minute").
- **Improvement:** This makes the experience more engaging and fun, especially for practice sessions.
