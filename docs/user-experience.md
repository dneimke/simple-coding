# Current User Experience and Recommendations for Improvement

## Current User Experience

The current user experience for creating and retrieving games follows this lifecycle:

1. **Starting a Game**:
   - The user navigates to the Tracker page.
   - The game session begins when the user clicks the "Start Game" button. This action enables event buttons and starts the timer.

2. **Recording Events**:
   - During the session, the user can log events by clicking the event buttons. These events are recorded with timestamps relative to the session's elapsed time.

3. **Completing a Game**:
   - Once the session is complete, the user clicks the "Complete" button (replacing the Reset button on the Tracker page). This action:
     - Saves the current game state (events and elapsed time) to `localStorage`.
     - Resets the game to its default, empty state, clearing the timer and event log.

4. **Loading a Game**:
   - If no session is currently active (i.e., the timer is stopped and no elapsed time is recorded), the "Load Game" button on the Log page becomes available.
   - Clicking "Load Game" retrieves the saved game state from `localStorage` and restores the events and elapsed time to the application.

5. **Restrictions**:
   - The "Complete" button is disabled until the game session starts.
   - The "Load Game" button is disabled during an active session to prevent overwriting the current state.

This flow ensures that users can efficiently manage game sessions while preventing conflicts between active and saved states.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Visual Feedback for Buttons**:
   - Add visual feedback (e.g., color changes or animations) when event buttons are clicked to confirm the action to the user.

2. **Game State Indicator**:
   - Display a clear indicator on the Tracker page showing whether a game is "In Progress" or "Completed."

3. **Confirmation for Completing a Game**:
   - Add a confirmation dialog when the user clicks the "Complete" button to prevent accidental resets.

4. **Saved Games Management**:
   - Allow users to view a list of saved games and select one to load, rather than relying on a single saved state.

5. **Enhanced Timeline View**:
   - On the Timeline page, provide a visual representation of events over time, such as markers on a timeline corresponding to event timestamps.

6. **Session Summary**:
   - After completing a game, display a summary of the session, including the total elapsed time and a list of recorded events.

7. **Error Handling for LocalStorage**:
   - Notify users if saving to or loading from `localStorage` fails (e.g., due to storage limits or browser restrictions).

8. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Ensure the interface is fully responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices, especially for event buttons and navigation.

9. **Customizable Timer**:
   - Allow users to set a custom start time or countdown timer for specific game scenarios.

10. **Help and Documentation**:
    - Add a "Help" section or tooltips to guide users on how to use the tracker, save/load games, and navigate the interface.
